## Dew Drop: Sturdy Farmland - Growth Edition

This project is a fork of [Dew Drop: Sturdy Farmland](https://github.com/coolbot100s/Dew-Drop-Farmland) by [coolbot100s](https://github.com/coolbot100s) adding growth behavior to sturdy farmland. It is meant to be used in the context of modpacks, as most of its features need additional kubejs/datapack functionality to work as intended.

## Features

### Daily Crop Growth

Every morning, crops will grow by 1 stage if they are watered. This is calculated using Serene Season's season system, and has Farmer's Delight compatibility for tomatoes as they are a weird crop.

This is best paired with a mod that disables random ticks, such as [No Random Ticks](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/no-random-ticks)


### Fertilized Farmland

To pair with the new growth system, three new fertilizers are added:

- Weak Fertilizer - Boosts initial crop growth by 1 day (Age)
- Strong Fertilizer - Boosts inital crop growth by 2 days (Ages)
- Hydrating Fertilizer - Does not dry in the morning
- Bountiful Fertilizer - A blank canvas for modpack makers to add their own mechanics


### Dependencies 

- [Serene Seasons](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/serene-seasons) version 9.0.0.46
- [Farmer's Delight](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/farmers-delight) version 1.2.6
