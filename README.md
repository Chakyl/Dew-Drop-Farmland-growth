## Dew Drop: Sturdy Farmland - Growth Edition

This project is a fork of [Dew Drop: Sturdy Farmland](https://github.com/coolbot100s/Dew-Drop-Farmland) by [coolbot100s](https://github.com/coolbot100s) adding growth behavior to sturdy farmland. It is meant to be used in the context of modpacks, as most of its features need additional kubejs/datapack functionality to work as intended.

## Features

### Daily Crop Growth

Every morning, crops will grow by 1 stage if they are watered. This is calculated using Serene Season's season system, and has Farmer's Delight compatibility for tomatoes as they are a weird crop.

This is best paired with a mod that disables random ticks, such as [No Random Ticks](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/no-random-ticks)

### Fertilized Farmland

To pair with the new growth system, six new fertilizers are added:

- Weak Fertilizer - Boosts initial crop growth by 1 day (Age)
- Strong Fertilizer - Boosts initial crop growth by 2 days (Ages)
- Hydrating Fertilizer - Does not dry in the morning until fully grown
- Bountiful Fertilizer - A blank canvas for modpack makers to add their own mechanics
- Low Quality Fertilizer - Blank farmland with a tag for Quality Food
- High Quality Fertilizer - Theoretical stronger version of the above

## Dependencies (Required Versions)
