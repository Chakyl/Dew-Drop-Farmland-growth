## Dew Drop Sturdy Farmland

Completely customize the behavior of farmland to make it builder-friendly, and add new immersive mechanics. Disable crop trampling, random ticks, or turning into dirt.

This server-side utility (Don't worry, you can still use it in your single-player worlds!) modifies farmland primarily for the purpose of the [Dew Drop project](https://modrinth.com/collection/1jZQOrlw), but has plenty of customizable features for everyone.  

By default, farmland will be able to **resist trampling**, and you'll be able to **place solid blocks on top of farmland** without losing it.  
**Farmland random ticking is also disabled**, meaning farmland will behave as if you had random tick speed set to 0, so water source blocks won't do anything to nearby farmland, and **farmland won't decay into dirt**.  

### Well how can you water your crops then?  

Sturdy Farmland introduces four new optional watering mechanics, you can now directly water a farmland block using a water bucket, or bottle of water, or water a small area all at once with a splash potion of water, if all else fails, you can simply wait for the rain!

*(Though, we think the best way to water your crops is with a [Watering Can](https://modrinth.com/mod/dew-drop-watering-cans))*

### Let's not make things too easy

If you're looking for a more immersive farming experience, than this mod may still be right for you! 
Inspired by the mechanics of Stardew Valley, farmland will dry out overnight, so you still have to water your crops each morning.

## Config
Every single feature mentioned here can be enabled or disabled in the config, you can also change the radius of splash water potions, how likely farmland is to revert (if at all), and when farmland will revert.    
These options work well with [Daily Weather](https://modrinth.com/project/daily-weather) another server-side mod that lets you control the weather!
